# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! Here you will find a selection of mini-projects that showcase my skills in applying machine learning models to real-world problems across various domains.

## Projects Overview

- **Linear Models and Validation Metrics**
  - `concrete+compressive+strength`: Predicting the compressive strength of concrete samples based on their ingredients and age.
  - `spambase`: Identifying spam emails using logistic regression and various validation metrics.

- **Logistic Regression Classifier HealthCare Model**
  - `xgBoost_Classifier`: Predicting patient readmissions in hospitals using XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm.

- **Non-Linear Models and Validation Metrics**
  - Various mini-models exploring non-linear data relationships and complex validation metrics.

## Highlights

- Utilization of **XGBoost** and **logistic regression** to address classification problems.
- Implementation of **validation techniques** to ensure the robustness and generalizability of models.
- Analysis of **multivariate datasets**, providing insights into feature relationships and importance.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python**: Main programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Library used for implementing machine learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive development and presentations.

## Installation

To run these projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
cd Machine-Learning-Projects
```

## Usage

Open the project folder in Jupyter Notebook and run the `.ipynb` files to interact with the code and data. OR run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook <notebook_name>.ipynb
```
