# Diabetes Risk Prediction using XGBoost

Explains the Python script designed for hypothetical situation created for __predicting__ diabetes risk using the __XGBoost algorithm__.


## Why XGBoost?
XGBoost builds an ensemble of decision trees in a sequential manner where each tree tries to correct the mistakes of the previous ones.

In this classification task, it uses features like Blood Pressure, BMI, etc., to learn patterns that can predict the likelihood of diabetes. __The final prediction is a combination of the insights gained from all the trees in the ensemble__.


## Why Use XGBClassifier?
In this diabetes risk prediction script, the XGBClassifier is an apt choice due to its ability to __handle complex datasets and provide high prediction accuracy__. The script aims to classify individuals into two categories (diabetes presence or absence) based on health metrics, which is a standard classification problem. XGBoost excels in such scenarios due to its robustness and effectiveness in capturing intricate patterns in the data.

## Overview

The python script is a __simple machine learning__ application using XGBoost for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health metrics.

## Dependencies

- **numpy**: Used for matrix operations and numerical processing.
- **xgboost**: The core machine learning algorithm used for building the predictive model.
- **sklearn.model_selection**: Provides functions for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **sklearn.metrics**: Used for evaluating the model's performance.

## Functions Explanation

### `load_data`
- **Purpose**: Loads a hypothetical healthcare dataset.
- **Data**: Consists of health metrics like _Blood Pressure, BMI, Age, and Glucose Level_. The target variable indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.
- **Returns**: Health metrics matrix (`X`) and target vector (`y`).

### `split_data`
- **Purpose**: Splits the dataset into _training and testing_ sets for model validation.
- **Functionality**: Uses `train_test_split` to randomly divide the dataset while ensuring data diversity in both sets.
- **Returns**: Split dataset into training (`X_train`, `y_train`) and testing (`X_test`, `y_test`) sets.

### `train_model`
- **Purpose**: Trains the XGBoost model for diabetes risk prediction.
- **Model**: `XGBClassifier` with `objective='binary:logistic'` indicating it's a binary classification task.
- **Returns**: Trained XGBoost model.

### `evaluate_model`
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the model's performance on the test set.
- **Method**: Uses `accuracy_score` to compare the predicted outcomes against the actual data.
- **Returns**: Accuracy of the model as a float value.

## Main Function (`main`)
- **Operation**: Integrates the data loading, splitting, model training, and evaluation process.
- **Output**: Prints the model's accuracy on the test data.

## Usage
To run the script, execute `python diabetes_risk_prediction.py` in a Python environment where all dependencies are installed.
